BNZ Advanced Analytics MLE Technical Exercise

This is an open-ended exercise and opportunity for you to demonstrate your capabilities and skills with
data. Use the following StatsNZ datasets (https://www.stats.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Businessemployment-data/Business-employment-data-March-2024-quarter/Download-data/businessemployment-data-march-2024-quarter.zip and https://www.stats.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Businessfinancial-data/Business-financial-data-March-2024-quarter/Download-data/business-financial-datamarch-2024.zip) to answer questions 1 to 5.
We request the answers be written in a Jupyter notebook or Google Colab notebook (see
https://colab.research.google.com/#scrollTo=OwuxHmxllTwN) and then committed to a Github
repository. Once you have completed the exercise, please email a link to your repository.
We would like to see the code you used to obtain the answers to questions 1 to 3 and request that you do
so using SQL operations performed using DuckDB. See https://duckdb.org/ for documentation on how
to do this.


Provide the answer and write a DuckDB SQL query that produces it.
For question 5 you are free to use the methodology of your choice (we have a preference that you use
Python if possible).



1. Of the industries where salaries and wages data did NOT exist in 2016 and only appeared later,
which industry had the highest average value for actual filled jobs across time and what was that
value?

create table average as
select  max(data_value)
from
(select period, average(data_value)
from employment_data
where Series_title_1 = "Filled jobs"
Filled jobs (workplace location based)
Series_title_3 = "Actual"
group by period) a
inner join (select unique a.Series_title_2
	    from financial_data
	    where period = "2016.02"
	    and period = "2016.03"
	    and period = "2016.04"
	    and period = "2016.05"
	    and period = "2016.06"
	    and period = "2016.07"
	    and period = "2016.08"
	    and period = "2016.09"
	    and period = "2016.10"
	    and period = "2016.11"
	    and period = "2016.12"
	    and Series_title_4 = "Seasonally adjusted")
on a.series_title_2 = b.series_title_2;



2. Provide the answer and write a DuckDB SQL query to show which year/month combination and
industry had the second highest seasonally adjusted operating income sales across all the
business industries in New Zealand that are categorised as NZSIOC level 2.

create table sales as select
unique period, row_number(), Series_title_2,
from financial_data
order by period, series_title_2
where Group = "Industry by financial variable (NZSIOC Level 2)"
and Series_title_4 = "Seasonally adjusted"
and Series_title_1 = "Sales (operating income)"
and row = 2;





3. Create a DuckDB SQL query to calculate the quarterly cumulative number of filled jobs over time
for the territorial authority with the highest average value of filled jobs across time. You may not
use window functions in your query.

proc sql;
create table summary as select
quarter(period) as quarter,
sum(data_value) as data_value,
avg(data_value) as average,
max(avg(data_value) as highest_average,
from employment
where series_title_1 = "Filled Jobs";
and group = Territorial authority by employment variable
group by quarter;


4. Assume these datasets are used in part of a pipeline where the file that arrives may contain
unwanted duplicates, incorrect datatypes, missing dates or other data quality aberrations. What
things could be done programmatically to make sure the input data is of adequate quality and
improve the pipeline?

Apart from the checks mentioned above, Completeness of the data, checking of the numbers against the front end system, checking against previous data, checking with stakeholders, Date checks, format checks.


5. Create summary statistics and perform a statistical analysis or create a model using the
provided datasets. We are interested in your justification for your choices and reasoning. You
may join the data to other datasets from https://www.stats.govt.nz/large-datasets/csv-files-fordownload/ if you wish.

Yearly sales by industry
proc freq data = financial_data; table Data_value*series_title_2*period;
run;


proc freq data = employment_data; table sales*series_title_2*period;
where series_Title_1 = run;
